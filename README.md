## Level 2: Program with Functions

## Description

This program analyzes data from a list of space missions. Each mission has information about its name, year, and success status.
A for loop is used to process this data and extract useful information.

The information to extract is:

Counts the total number of space missions.
Counts the number of successful missions.
Calculates the success rate of the missions.
Lists all the missions that were launched before the year 2000.

The data sample is as follows:

mission_names = ['Apollo 11', 'Challenger', 'Curiosity Rover', 'Viking 1', 'Mars Pathfinder', 'Hubble Telescope', 'Apollo 13']
mission_years = [1969, 1986, 2012, 1975, 1996, 1990, 1970]
mission_success = [True, False, True, True, True, True, False]
